# HappySampler
Sampler project for bachelor thesis

Buglist: 

* make gain-slider start in the middle 
* Sound played too long makes the sound crash
* abort fileload makes program crash
* do i need edit gaincontrol in SamplerSound AND SamplerVoice???
* gain sliders need to start in the middle at 1 and need to go to 2 and down to 0 
* App ist too slow 
* Thumbnail only reloads when i move frame out of window maybe try to refresh gui 
* add some kind of data management 
* Using Apply Button without file lets program crash so only paint them when there is a file loaded
*adsr is missing
